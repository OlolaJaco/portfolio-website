export const About_Content: string = `Hi, I‚Äôm Akinbusola Akinola, a detail-driven Fullstack Web Developer with 2+ years of experience building performant, user-centric web applications.

I specialize in the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React/Next.js, Node.js), crafting both frontend and backend solutions that are responsive, scalable, and optimized for real-world impact.

üîß On day one at Golvia, I resolved a critical authentication bug, unlocking investor access for live testing, a key enabler in closing a $10,000 funding deal.
üõ∏ I‚Äôve also boosted Shareduled‚Äôs organic reach to 3,000+ monthly impressions by engineering SEO-ready, high-performance frontend experiences.
ü§ù Whether working solo or within cross-functional teams, I approach every project with a problem-solving mindset and a passion for user experience.

Beyond coding, I‚Äôm actively exploring how AI and emerging technologies can enhance modern development, and I enjoy mentoring junior developers through teaching and collaboration.

I‚Äôm currently open to full-time roles where I can contribute to innovative teams, build products that matter, and keep growing as a developer.

üëâ Let‚Äôs create something impactful together.`;
